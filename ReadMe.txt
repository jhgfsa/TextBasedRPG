For Assignment 5, I think there are a lot of potential usages of design patterns. One that immediately stood out to me was to 
have a factory/builder for enemies and floors. We're going to be making a lot of them, and enemies especially could have lots of 
different attributes that would make a huge constructor, so a builder could really help with reducing complexity and code size. 
A singleton design pattern could also be used for the final boss since there will only be one boss object. The decorator pattern could 
also be used to add additional abilities and stats to the main character after level-up. Finally an observer pattern would be helpful
since our main character will be constantly changing stats, gold, etc, so it would allow easy notifcation to classes handling shops and fights.
These are just some rough ideas that I will iron out and decide on.
